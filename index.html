  <h1> Hello, dear visitor! </h1>  
  <h2> My name is Alina and this page is about me, me and more of me. </h2>
  <p> I am 17 and I live in Moscow. </p>
  <p> I had done ballroom dancing for 10 years. So I think that I might be a good dancer. Kind of.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RGkdVo07HA&list=LLjdrfTjeQtYOMJSpN-MuMWg&index=37"> You can find some videos here.</a></p>
  <p> At the moment I am the student of the HSE. </p>
  <p> I enjoy taking pictures, watching horror movies and learning French in the university.</p>
  <p> Also I like to sing, despite the fact that I do not have 'the voice', and to listen to the music. </p>

  <p> One of my biggest wishes is for everyone to be happy! So smile, please :)</p>
  <br>
  <p> You can contact me, if you want to know me better. </p>
